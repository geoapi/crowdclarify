Compose an arbitrary number of functions that accept one argument and return either a value or a Promise.

```
$ npm install promise-compose
```


## Usage

```js
import assert from 'assert'
import compose from 'promise-compose'

const double = x => x * 2
const square = x => x * x
const root = x => Promise.resolve(Math.sqrt(x))

// From left to right.
compose(root, double, square)(9)
.then(result => assert.equal(result, 36))

// From right to left.
compose.right(square, double, root)(9)
.then(result => assert.equal(result, 36))
```

This library assumes that `Promise` is a global that implements the ES6 Promise specification. If you're not sure if the environment has `Promise` or you want to use something else, simply override `compose.Promise`.
